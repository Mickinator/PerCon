# PerCon
Performance Controller for keyboard action
PerCon Presentation		     	April 2020, Norbert Schreiber
I try to build Performance Controller (PerCon). I learned my first program language in the 1970 with a kind of „assembler“. The language was to use very serial. Since 2 month I work with python and if you read the script you‘ll see that there‘s a lot of potential for improvement. So please, be 
generous. And, I think it could be a good example for teamwork, if evrerybody with ideas helps to make it ready.

PerCon is gig-orientated and plays background-files (wav, mp3), sends single events, can toggle between CCs and notes or chords. It can momentary switches, program-changes, flip between channels, SysEx-Data (in any lenght) and it can send a chord-progressions. All that will be edited in an Excel-Sheet. And all that works, but to slow ;-( for using on a gig. And another point is, that not all situations are save. Sometimes the program stops with errors.
PerCon works with 10 knobs. I use 4 Fingerknobs and 6 footswitches to control the system. The response works with small sounds, so you do not need a monitor. But if you‘re at home you can use SSH and VNC to see additional comments on the screen.
Future subjects can be parallel sending of audio and midi (to send midi-commands) or block-sending of commands with one knob.     

I‘ve made a folder with all needet files and informations and I would be glad to read your comments. There is also a document with questions I have to solve. 

It‘s Version No #0. And there‘s a lot to do. So feel free to work with it and make it better 8-)
